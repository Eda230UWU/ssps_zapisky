# Homeschooling x attending school regularly

I don't personally think homeschooling has many positives and it's just another thing "alternative mothers" thought of for their "special" children.

Yeah, you know what your child is learning and the "bad evil goverment can't force  propaganda your childs throat, these damn liberals",

on a serious note the one positive to homeschooling i see is security. You always know what your child is doing, nobody is going to beat him up or he's not going to end up in a school shooti

but your child isn't going to really form any kind of friendships. This could lead to introverted personality, fear of places with a lot of people and generaly bad communication skills. I've personally had a classmate and he was homeschooled since kindergarden and he was allowed to go to school after completing his 5th grade. He was really introverted and hadn't talked that much. It gradually got better and he became more talkative as time went on. I think his only luck was that his mother let him join our school in Beroun
