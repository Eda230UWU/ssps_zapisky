I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random score posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. "Oh that looks kinda like the Blue Zenith 727 score" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a clock with time that showed 7:27, I'd see that I'm on the 7/27 page on my school homework, my last notice to pay my electricity bill is 727$ , I'd notice that it's been 727 days since the last time I touched a woman. I can't fucking live like this. I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the phrase "when you see it" again without thinking of 727. I can't live anymore. 727 has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence.
